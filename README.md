# 🌤️ SkyCast - Real-Time Weather App

**SkyCast** is a sleek and simple web application that provides real-time weather information based on user input or current location. The app is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and fetches live weather data using the **WeatherAPI** service.

## 🔑 Focus: Role of the API Key

At the core of this project lies the **API key**, which is essential for accessing real-time weather data. Here's how it's used:

- The API key is provided by [WeatherAPI.com](https://weatherapi.com), which acts as a gateway to fetch accurate and current weather information.
- Every weather request made by the app—whether for a user-typed city or GPS location—is authenticated using this key.
- Without the API key, the app cannot retrieve any weather data, making it a vital component of the application.
- It ensures secure, trackable, and quota-limited access to the external weather service.
